# Book-App

**Author**: Sean M and Joanna C
**Version**: 1.1.0 (filled in comments)

## Overview
The application allows the user to find books and add them to a view port where they can see their chosen books. It has functionality to see all of the books selected from a search query as well as view a single book and the details attached to that book. This is a great aplication to manage the user's favorite books and see them all in one place in a clean and condensed view.


## Getting Started
If someone wanted to build this application for themselves they would need to install npm packages and begin scaffolding the website. Because this is an SPA they would need to use page.js and CRUD to manage their routes on events. Also they would need to deploy a database to Heroku or someother database prop website. 

## Architecture
This application uses many different languages and architecures. The vanilla is JS, HTML, & CSS. We used Pages.js, JQuery.js, Handlebars.js, & SQL. We used the google api to manage our search for new books to add to our list of favorites. We used superagent middleware in order to managae a token to access the admin page and admin functionality.
